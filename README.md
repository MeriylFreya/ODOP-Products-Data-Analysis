# ODOP-Products-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **One District One Product (ODOP)** dataset. The objective of this analysis is to understand the distribution, sectoral composition, geographic concentration, and Geographical Indication (GI) status of ODOP products across Indian states and districts.

The analysis uses data visualization and statistical summaries to uncover meaningful patterns that can support policy insights, economic planning, and sector development strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about ODOP products from multiple Indian states and union territories. Key fields in the dataset include:

- **State** – State or Union Territory where the product is identified  
- **District** – District associated with the ODOP product  
- **Product** – Name of the identified product  
- **Category** – Economic classification (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Others)  
- **Sector** – Sector such as Agriculture, Handicraft, Textile, Manufacturing, etc.  
- **GI Status** – Whether the product has Geographical Indication (GI) recognition  
- **Ministry/Department** – Government body associated with the product

## Objectives of the Analysis

The main goals of this project were:

1. To analyze how ODOP products are distributed across states and districts  
2. To understand sector-wise and category-wise product composition  
3. To assess the prevalence of GI-tagged products  
4. To identify leading states and sectors in ODOP participation  
5. To explore product diversity across regions

## Key Findings

### 1. Strong State-Level Concentration
A small group of states contributes a disproportionately large share of ODOP products, indicating regional concentration in ODOP participation.

### 2. Dominance of Primary Category Products
Most ODOP products fall under the **Primary category**, showing strong dependence on agriculture and natural resource-based goods.

### 3. Agriculture as the Leading Sector
The **Agriculture sector** accounts for the largest share of ODOP products, highlighting the rural and agrarian foundation of the ODOP initiative.

### 4. Significant Role of Handicrafts and Textiles
Handicrafts, handloom, and textile sectors form a major portion of the dataset, demonstrating the importance of traditional industries and artisan-based livelihoods.

### 5. Low GI Tag Penetration
Only a small percentage of ODOP products currently have **Geographical Indication (GI)** status, suggesting strong potential for expanding GI registrations.

### 6. Variation in Sector Specialization by State
Some states show clear specialization in specific sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, or textiles, reflecting regional strengths.

### 7. Uneven Product Diversity Across States
Certain states have a high number of unique products, indicating strong diversity, while others have fewer but more specialized offerings.

### 8. Ministry-Level Involvement is Sector-Driven
The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare is associated with the highest number of products, followed by ministries linked to handicrafts, textiles, and MSMEs.

### 9. Districts with Multiple ODOP Products
Several districts are associated with more than one ODOP product, indicating localized clusters of economic activity rather than a strict one-product-per-district model.

### 10. Sectoral Composition Highlights Development Opportunities
The smaller representation of secondary and tertiary categories suggests scope for value addition, processing, branding, and service-linked development.

## Visualization Techniques Used

The analysis includes a variety of visualizations:

- Pie chart for category distribution  
- Donut chart for GI vs Non-GI products  
- Horizontal bar charts for top contributing states  
- Stacked bar charts for sector vs category relationships  
- Heatmap for state–sector concentration patterns  
- Treemap for sectoral share visualization  
- Comparative charts for ministries and product diversity  

These visual tools help reveal patterns not easily visible in raw tables.

## Conclusion

The ODOP dataset reveals a program strongly rooted in agriculture and traditional sectors, with significant regional variation in product type and diversity. While participation is widespread, GI recognition remains limited, presenting opportunities for improved branding and legal protection.

The findings highlight the importance of:

- Supporting value addition in primary products  
- Strengthening GI registration efforts  
- Promoting sector-specific development strategies based on regional strengths  

Overall, the ODOP initiative demonstrates strong potential to drive localized economic growth and preserve traditional industries.
